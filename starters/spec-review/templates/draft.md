## Task
Create an initial specification draft.

Don't worry about perfection - just capture your current thinking. We'll improve it through structured review.

## Output Requirements

Create `spec-draft.md` with:

### Goal
What are you trying to accomplish?

### Context  
Why is this needed? What problem does it solve?

### Approach
High-level approach to solving the problem.

### Requirements
List key requirements (functional and non-functional).

### Open Questions
What are you uncertain about?

## Guidelines
- Be as complete as you can
- Mark areas where you're uncertain
- Don't spend too long - this is a draft

## Assumptions
- (List assumptions - e.g., "We have time for a 2-week implementation")


## Output Format Constraints
CRITICAL: You must output ONLY the raw markdown content for the file.
- Do NOT include any conversational text (e.g. "Here is the file...", "I will now...").
- Do NOT include markdown code block fences (```markdown ... ```) around the content.
- Start directly with the markdown content (e.g. # Title).
